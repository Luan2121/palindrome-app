## ðŸ““ About the project

  

We're using [lerna JS](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage monorepo so we can code our apps in the same repository.

  

## ðŸŒ  How to run the project?

First of all you must install apps dependencies by using the command `lerna boostrap`

  

Then you can start the apps simoultaneusly using the command `lerna run dev` or running all the projects in differents consoles using the dev command on each package

  

but if you are a cool guy ðŸ˜Ž you can run the project using [docker](https://www.docker.com/) by running the command `docker-compose up -d`
